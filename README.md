# Open-source-Large-CNC
In this Github-Repo you can find the Documentation and CAD files for a large format CNC-machine we build with OpenBuilds parts.

The total size of the machine is roughly:
-	X: 172 cm
-	Y: 172 cm
-	Z: 128 cm
and weights around 200 kg.

For further information you should take a look in the .pdf file! 

Filestructure:

- Bilder: contains (additional) pictures to those in the pdf
- CAD-files: contains CAD-files (who would have thought). Furthermore you can check out the online model here: http://a360.co/2y7nwAO 
- Motormounts-dxf: The 3D-DXF files for the motor mounts, so that you donÂ´t have to extract them form the CAD-model for milling
- Aufbauanleitung.pdf: Contains the "manual" on how to build the CNC. For reference always stick to the CAD.
- CNC-Mill-v3... : A high quality render of the finished machine
- CNC-OpenBuilds.pdf: THE MOST IMPORTANT DOCUMENT. It provides you with further information on the design decisions, ...
- SLP...: The scematic. IT IS 28 PAGES. And was done professionaly. So if you think about building a CNC-machine and want to do it right, this is a great starting point.

As you can see we are still missing some parts (for the second y-axis).
